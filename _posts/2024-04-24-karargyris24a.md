title: Discussion and recommendations from the 2023 "Gaze Meets ML" workshop breakout
  session
abstract: 'The Gaze Meets ML (GMML) workshop at NeurIPS aims to bring together diverse
  machine learning communities to foster research that leverages eye gaze (visual
  attention) to fulfill synergy between human attention/cognition and machine learning
  model development and evaluation. Towards this mission, the 2023 GMML workshop ran
  a breakout session to foster the research community by discussing open challenges.
  Three focus breakout session areas were identified through a selection process:
  Datasets, Community, and Vision and Actions for the Future. The findings and discussion
  points from this session were collected during the meeting and further organized
  and expanded after the meeting for efficient presentation here. The following sections
  detail each topic.'
